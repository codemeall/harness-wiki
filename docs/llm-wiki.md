# LLM Wiki

LLM Wiki is a separate product workflow from Harness Bridge. It creates a long-lived markdown knowledge base maintained by an AI agent: you curate sources and ask questions; the agent summarizes, cross-references, files, flags contradictions, and keeps the index current.

Harness Bridge tracks **current in-flight work** in one project repo. LLM Wiki tracks **durable knowledge** across projects, research, and decisions.

## What it is

An LLM Wiki is a structured, interlinked collection of markdown files:

- `raw/` holds source material you curate: articles, papers, meeting notes, transcripts, design docs, screenshots in `raw/assets/`.
- `wiki/entities/` holds people, organizations, products, places, and other named things.
- `wiki/concepts/` holds ideas, frameworks, methods, features, and design patterns.
- `wiki/sources/` holds one summary page per ingested raw source.
- `wiki/syntheses/` holds comparisons, decisions, analyses, and designs worth keeping.
- `wiki/index.md` catalogs every page with a one-line summary.
- `wiki/log.md` records every ingest, query, lint, and schema operation.

Unlike file-upload RAG, the wiki compiles knowledge into durable pages. New sources update the existing structure instead of being retrieved from scratch on every query.

## LLM Wiki vs Harness Bridge

| | LLM Wiki | Harness Bridge |
|---|---|---|
| Primary job | Preserve durable knowledge and decisions | Resume one in-progress coding task |
| Scope | Cross-project or long-lived domain context | One project repo and current task |
| Lifespan | Months or years | Per task / per handoff |
| Path | A vault directory | `.harness/bridge.md` in a project repo |
| Main operations | Ingest, query, lint | Init, checkpoint, produce, consume, recover |

Use both together when a project has meaningful design history: the wiki stores the *why*, the project repo stores the *what*, and the bridge stores the *current work*.

## When to use it

Set up an LLM Wiki when:

- You are starting a non-trivial project and want design history preserved separately from implementation.
- You are doing research across many sources over weeks or months.
- You want a reusable product/design memory that future AI sessions can query.
- You have multiple sibling repos that share decisions, concepts, or research.
- You want contradictions and stale assumptions surfaced instead of buried in old chats.

Skip it for one-off tasks, ephemeral notes, or reference material that is already easy to find elsewhere.

## Setup

Two setup paths are supported. MCP is recommended when your agent supports it; the prompt path is the fallback.

### MCP setup

Configure the package as an MCP server in your agent:

```bash
npx -y @codemeall/harness-wiki mcp
```

Or from a Git checkout:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd harness-wiki
npm install
npm run build
node /absolute/path/to/harness-wiki/dist/cli.js mcp
```

Open the target directory in your agent and say:

```text
Use harness-wiki to initialize an LLM Wiki vault here.
Name: "knowledge"
Domain: software project
```

The agent calls `vault_init`. The tool auto-detects the scenario:

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| Empty directory | Writes a standalone vault with `raw/`, `wiki/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `wiki/index.md`, and `wiki/log.md`. |
| Existing project repo | Creates the vault folders in place and appends a marker-fenced vault schema to the host `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` without overwriting existing content. |

Use `vault_status` any time to report scaffold state and list files in `raw/` that do not yet have matching `wiki/sources/<slug>.md` pages.

### Prompt setup

If your agent does not support MCP:

1. Open the directory that should become the vault.
2. Paste [`prompts/vault-init.md`](../prompts/vault-init.md) as the first message.
3. Answer the agent's domain questions.
4. Review the generated `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `wiki/index.md`, and `wiki/log.md`.
5. Optionally `git init` the vault if you want history.

## Daily workflow

LLM Wiki has three operations: ingest, query, and lint.

### Ingest

Drop a source into `raw/`, then tell the agent:

```text
ingest raw/prd-checkout-v2.md
```

The agent reads the source, surfaces key takeaways before writing, then creates or updates the relevant source, entity, concept, synthesis, index, and log pages after your confirmation.

Good sources include design specs, ADRs, meeting transcripts, user interviews, research notes, articles, papers, and substantive product feedback.

### Query

Ask normal questions:

```text
What did we decide about guest checkout?
```

The agent reads `wiki/index.md`, drills into relevant pages, follows `[[wikilinks]]`, and answers with citations back to wiki pages and source summaries. If the answer is a durable synthesis, the agent can file it as a new `wiki/syntheses/<slug>.md`.

### Lint

Periodically ask:

```text
lint
```

The agent audits the wiki for contradictions, stale claims, orphan pages, missing cross-references, important concepts without pages, and useful next sources or questions.

## Paired projects

A vault can feed one or more sibling project repos. The vault stores design rationale, research, and decisions; project repos store implementation and public deliverables.

The generated schema includes a `Paired projects` table:

```markdown
## Paired projects
| Project | Path | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| <project-name> | `../<project-name>/` | <one line> | <design / building / shipped> |
```

When a synthesis becomes an approved design, implementation should happen in the project repo. If the implementation session is long-running, use Harness Bridge inside that project repo to maintain `.harness/bridge.md`.

## What belongs where

| Goes in LLM Wiki | Goes in project repo |
|---|---|
| Why you chose one approach over another | Code, tests, and shipped docs |
| Raw notes, interviews, research, competitive context | Public README and changelog |
| Design rationale and private decision history | Contributor-facing design docs |
| Cross-project concepts and syntheses | Project-specific implementation state |

A useful test: if a contributor needs it to understand or change the code, it probably belongs in the project repo. If it is private context, exploration, or long-term thinking, it belongs in the wiki.

## CLI fallback

The `harness-wiki` package includes local CLI commands:

```bash
harness-wiki vault-init --name "knowledge" --domain "software project"
harness-wiki vault-status
```

From a Git checkout:

```bash
node /absolute/path/to/harness-wiki/dist/cli.js vault-init --name "knowledge"
node /absolute/path/to/harness-wiki/dist/cli.js vault-status
```

## Uninstall

An LLM Wiki is just a folder of markdown files. To remove it, delete the vault folder or remove it from your editor/Obsidian workspace. Nothing is registered globally.
